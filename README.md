# Cosmic Verge: Prelude

**This is not something we've committed to as a project, currently it's just an exploration of an idea while testing the alpha version of BonsaiDb.**

A text-based persistent multiplayer puzzler and dungeon crawler.

## Goals

- Have fun.
- [Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) our
  database, [BonsaiDb](https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb).
- Explore creating a minimalistic game with a focus on testing BonsaiDb.

## Setting

On a planet in another universe, the landscape is marked by towers that clearly
were made. But they seemingly were made before any intelligent life on this
planet existed. Cave paintings and stone tablets clearly depict the towers.

Two millinnia ago the secret to opening the first tower was discovered. Many
theorized over the years that these towers were placed by an alien species, but
it wasn't until a young scientist noticed a link between some of the markings
and some of the recently discovered elements.

The world changed forever when we discovered these towers seemed designed to be
a library to those who are worthy to the knowledge.

## Premise

This is an origin story of the MMO that [@ecton](https://github.com/ecton)
eventually wants to build. The setting takes place on the home world of the
primary human-like species in the game. Their planet is in the outskirts of
their galaxy, providing some nights of near total darkness and on other nights,
splendid views looking in towards the center of their own galazy.
